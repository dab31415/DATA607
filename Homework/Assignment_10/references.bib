    abstract     = "{AFINN} is a list of English words rated for valence with an integer
between minus five (negative) and plus five (positive). The words have
been manually labeled by Finn {\AA}rup Nielsen in 2009-2011. The file
is tab-separated. There are two versions:

 {AFINN-}111: Newest version with 2477 words and phrases.

 {AFINN-}96: 1468 unique words and phrases on 1480 lines. Note that there
are 1480 lines, as some words are listed twice. The word list in not
entirely in alphabetic ordering.  

An evaluation of the word list is available in:

abstract = {Much of the data available today is unstructured and text-heavy, making it challenging
for analysts to apply their usual data wrangling and visualization tools. With this
practical book, youll explore text-mining techniques with tidytext, a package that
authors Julia Silge and David Robinson developed using the tidy principles behind
R packages like ggraph and dplyr. Youll learn how tidytext and other tidy tools in
R can make text analysis easier and more effective. The authors demonstrate how treating
text as data frames enables you to manipulate, summarize, and visualize characteristics
of text. Youll also learn how to integrate natural language processing (NLP) into
effective workflows. Practical code examples and data explorations will help you generate
real insights from literature, news, and social media. Learn how to apply the tidy
text format to NLPUse sentiment analysis to mine the emotional content of text Identify
a documents most important terms with frequency measurements Explore relationships
and connections between words with the ggraph and widyr packages Convert back and
forth between Rs tidy and non-tidy text formatsUse topic modeling to classify document
collections into natural groups Examine case studies that compare Twitter archives,
dig into NASA metadata, and analyze thousands of Usenet messages},
